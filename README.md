# Py-k-mon: Very much a WIP

It's **Pokémon Fire Red** but completely built from scratch in Pygame!

### Why though?

Pokémon presents a lot of interesting data structure problems. Also Gen 1 (Blue, specifically) was a very formative game during my childhood, so there's that too. And FRLG combines the nostalgia of Gen 1 with the GBA, my favorite handheld platform.

### State of the game

So far all you can do is walk around Pallet Town! But map generation, tile grids, sprites, animation, WASD controls, collision detection and map transitions work.

Next up: A pause/menu system. Oh, and then actual Pokémon.

### Notes

Py-k-mon was built and tested with Pygame 2.5.1, Python 3.10, and Ubuntu 22.04.3. Thanks to [Spriters Resource](https://www.spriters-resource.com/game_boy_advance/pokemonfireredleafgreen/) for the images!
